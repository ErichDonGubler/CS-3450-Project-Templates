**Driver**

The driver for this php application is `program.php`. This script will be called when `build.bat` or `build.sh` are executed on their respective terminals. Use `program.php` as the entry point for your program. All other script implementations are in the `/src` directory.

**Windows**

This template comes pre-packaged with a stripped down version of PHP 7.1 (x86) distribution which only includes cli and json support. If you need another extension besides these two, you will need to install your own distro. This should work on most windows platforms. To execute this project on windows with this pre-packaged distro, run `build.bat` from the command line.

**Linux / Mac**

For OSs that use bash you will need to install PHP first through your package manager. To execute this project from a bash supporting OS, run `build.sh` from the terminal after php installed.

**Other Tips**

In both cases you will need to make sure that php is in your path or in your cwd.
